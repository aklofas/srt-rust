# Sanitizer suppressions

Files in this directory tune the nightly `sanitizers` GHA workflow
(see `.github/workflows/sanitizers.yml`).

## Files

## When to add a suppression

When a nightly run surfaces a finding that's:
- A false positive from a third-party dependency we don't control AND
- Doesn't affect production code AND
- Has no realistic upstream fix path.

**Always include in the suppression block:**
- The date it was added.
- A 1-2 line description of the symptom.
- The CI run URL that surfaced it.
- A pointer to a follow-up issue, plan, or "investigate within N weeks" note.

## When to remove a suppression

- The underlying issue was fixed (in our code or upstream).
- The follow-up date passed AND nobody re-triaged: remove it and let it
  surface again on the next nightly run — fresh data is more useful
  than stale assumptions.
