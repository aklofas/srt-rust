/*
 * rtp_basic.c — Minimal RTP sender: pre-built TS packets over UDP/RTP.
 *
 * Demonstrates the lowest-level RTP send API: `tst_rtp_sender_t`. This is
 * the "raw TS bytes" path — the caller provides 188-byte-aligned MPEG-TS
 * packets and the library wraps them in RTP (RFC 2250) datagrams before
 * handing off to UDP. No mux config, no encoder state, no stream handles.
 *
 * This is distinct from `tst_rtp_mux_sender_t` (which owns a full MPEG-TS
 * muxer and accepts encoded NAL / KLV / audio frames). Use `tst_rtp_sender_t`
 * when your upstream already produces TS packets — for example a hardware
 * encoder, a relay from a file, or a downstream repackager.
 *
 * What this example shows:
 *   1. CLI arg parsing: --dest host:port (unicast) or multicast address.
 *   2. Building an rtp:// URL with optional pkt_size and ttl query params.
 *   3. Opening a tst_rtp_sender_t and checking for NULL + last-error.
 *   4. Synthesising structurally valid 188-byte TS null packets as "payload".
 *   5. Pushing 100 of those packets via tst_rtp_sender_send_ts.
 *   6. Closing cleanly via tst_rtp_sender_close.
 *
 * Why MPEG-TS over RTP for gimbaled platforms?
 *   RFC 2250 defines the RTP payload format for MPEG-TS: each UDP datagram
 *   carries one RTP header (12 bytes) followed by 1..N 188-byte TS packets.
 *   Multicast delivery lets a single airborne sender reach ground stations,
 *   recording servers, and real-time display simultaneously without unicast
 *   fan-out at the sender — critical when the platform link budget is tight.
 *   The receiver side mirrors this with `tst_rtp_recv_open`.
 *
 * Build (from the ts-transformer workspace root):
 *   SRT_FORCE_VENDORED=1 cargo build -p tst-c
 *   cc -I bindings/c/include \
 *      -L target/debug \
 *      -Wall -Werror \
 *      -o /tmp/rtp_basic \
 *      bindings/c/examples/c/sending/rtp_basic.c -ltstrans -lpthread -ldl
 *   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=target/debug /tmp/rtp_basic
 *
 * Run (unicast, default):
 *   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=target/debug /tmp/rtp_basic
 *
 * Run with explicit destination (unicast):
 *   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=target/debug /tmp/rtp_basic --dest 192.168.1.100:5000
 *
 * Run (multicast):
 *   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=target/debug /tmp/rtp_basic --dest 239.1.2.3:5000
 *
 * Receive with ffplay (in a separate terminal):
 *   ffplay rtp://239.1.2.3:5000
 *   # or for unicast: ffplay rtp://127.0.0.1:5000

/*
 * MPEG-TS packet size: exactly 188 bytes, standardised in ISO/IEC 13818-1
 * (H.222.0) §2.4.3.2. Every cell of the bitstream must be a multiple of
 * this length; receivers use it to re-synchronise on byte-stream boundaries.
 * RTP senders SHOULD align datagram payloads to multiples of 188.
 */
#define TS_PACKET_SIZE   188

/*
 * MPEG-TS sync byte: 0x47. The first byte of every TS packet. A receiver
 * that loses sync scans forward byte by byte looking for 0x47 at offset 0,
 * then 188, then 376, etc. to reacquire framing. If the sync byte is wrong
 * the packet is discarded at the transport layer.
 */
#define TS_SYNC_BYTE     0x47

/*
 * The null PID (0x1FFF = 8191 in decimal) is used for "null packets" —
 * TS cells carrying no useful payload. Hardware encoders pad CBR streams
 * with null packets to maintain a constant bit rate. Here we use them as
 * a convenient stand-in for real video/KLV data: every receiver is required
 * to silently discard null packets per §2.4.4.4.
 *
 * PID is a 13-bit field occupying bits [12:0] of the second+third bytes of
 * the TS header. 0x1FFF encodes as 0x1F in byte[1] (high bits) + 0xFF in
 * byte[2] (low bits). The transport_error_indicator and
 * payload_unit_start_indicator bits in byte[1] are 0.
 */

 * the sender's RTP sequence-number and timestamp update logic across
 * multiple datagrams (pkt_size defaults to 7×188 = 1316 bytes per UDP
 * datagram, so 100 / 7 ≈ 15 UDP sends).

/*
 * make_null_ts_packet — fill `buf` (exactly TS_PACKET_SIZE bytes) with a
 * valid MPEG-TS null packet (PID 0x1FFF, no adaptation field, no payload).
 *
 * WHY a null packet rather than random bytes?
 *   Null packets have a defined PID that every conformant receiver discards
 *   without parsing the payload. Using 0xFF-filled payload after the 4-byte
 *   header is the standard stuffing byte per H.222.0 §2.4.3.8. This means
 *   any receiver that actually reads these datagrams (e.g. ffplay) won't
 *   emit spurious parse errors — it'll simply ignore all 100 packets.
 *
 * WHY is `continuity_counter` set to 0 unconditionally?
 *   Null packets have no continuity counter requirement; receivers ignore
 *   the CC field for PID 0x1FFF per §2.4.3.3. A real sender would
 *   increment CC per-PID; for synthetic null traffic it doesn't matter.
 *
 * TS header layout (4 bytes):
 *   byte[0]: sync_byte                         = 0x47
 *   byte[1]: transport_error_indicator(1b)=0
 *            payload_unit_start_indicator(1b)=0
 *            transport_priority(1b)=0
 *            PID[12:8](5b) = 0x1F (null PID high 5 bits)

 *   byte[3]: transport_scrambling_control(2b)=00
