/*
 * recv_raw_to_file.c — bind a listener on srt://:7000, recv raw TS
 * bytes from the first peer, write every message chunk to the file
 * path given in argv[1], exit cleanly on peer disconnect.
 *
 * Why this example:
 *   The simplest receiver-side teaching code. Demonstrates:
 *     1. Listener-mode bind via tst_raw_receiver_open_listener — no
 *        connect-handshake; the library waits for the remote peer to
 *        call connect() to us.
 *     2. The recv loop shape: pull one message at a time, write it to
 *        disk, loop.
 *     3. The four-way exit-code interpretation for tst_raw_receiver_recv:
 *        success, EOS (peer FIN), cancelled (our side), transport error,
 *        and message-too-large.
 *     4. Correct teardown order: always call _close to free the handle,
 *        even on error paths.
 *
 * How to run:
 *   1. In one terminal (receiver first, so the port is ready):
 *        ./recv_raw_to_file out.ts
 *   2. In another terminal (any sender targeting srt://127.0.0.1:7000 —
 *      tst_raw_receiver_recv treats every inbound message opaquely, so
 *      any caller-mode sender works, e.g.):
 *        cargo run -p tst-examples --example ts_relay_from_file -- input.ts 127.0.0.1:7000
 *   3. When the sender disconnects, recv_raw_to_file exits automatically.
 *   4. Inspect the output:
 *        ffprobe out.ts
 *        tsp -I file out.ts -P analyze   # TSDuck PSI/SI walk
 *
 * Build (from the ts-transformer workspace root):
 *   SRT_FORCE_VENDORED=1 cargo build -p tst-c
 *   cc -I bindings/c/include \
 *      -L target/debug \
 *      -Wl,-rpath,target/debug \
 *      -Wall -Wextra -Werror \
 *      -o /tmp/recv_raw_to_file \
 *      bindings/c/examples/receiving/recv_raw_to_file.c -ltstrans
 *
 * Run:
 *   /tmp/recv_raw_to_file out.ts
 *
 * Closest Rust analog: examples/receiving/srt_listener_to_file.rs
 * (listener bind, recv loop, write to file). The C version is more
 * verbose because there is no RAII, and because C readers may have less
 * context about what the safe Rust wrappers underneath are doing on
 * their behalf.

/*
 * Recv buffer sizing.
 *
 * WHY 1500 bytes?
 *   libsrt's default maximum payload per message in live mode is 1316
 *   bytes (7 × 188, seven MPEG-TS packets per SRT message, at the
 *   IP-1500 MTU).  Senders can configure a larger payload, but 1500
 *   covers every default-configured sender.  If a sender is configured
 *   with a custom (larger) payload size and sends a message that exceeds
 *   RECV_BUF_LEN, tst_raw_receiver_recv returns TST_E_TOO_LARGE instead
 *   of truncating — the recv loop below handles this correctly.
 *
 * WHY not stack-allocate a much larger buffer "just in case"?
 *   Large stack buffers can overflow the default 8 MB stack on Linux
 *   (ulimit -s).  The recv loop retries after TST_E_TOO_LARGE with a
 *   heap-allocated fallback.  For production code you would read the
 *   sender's configured payload size via the SRT stats API and size the
 *   buffer accordingly.

/*
 * Fallback heap buffer when a single message exceeds RECV_BUF_LEN.
 *
 * WHY 16 * 1024 * 1024 (16 MiB)?
 *   SRT's documented maximum packet payload is bounded by the underlying
 *   UDP socket's receive buffer.  In practice, custom configurations rarely
 *   exceed a few hundred KB.  16 MiB is a generous ceiling that covers any
 *   realistic sender while still being small compared to typical available
 *   RAM.  Exceeding this would indicate a misconfigured or adversarial peer.

     * WHY tst_raw_receiver_open_listener rather than tst_raw_receiver_open?
     *   tst_raw_receiver_open is the URL-dispatch entry point: the URL's
     *   `?mode=caller` (the default) dials out, while `?mode=listener`
     *   routes through the listener path.  tst_raw_receiver_open_listener
     *   forces listener mode regardless of any mode= value in the URL.
     *   For unambiguous listener-mode code, the _listener suffix is clearer
     *   than `?mode=listener` buried in the URL string.
     *
     * WHY "srt://:7000" (empty host, no ?mode=listener)?
     *   With _open_listener entry points, the function name is the
     *   authoritative listener-mode signal.  You can write "srt://:7000"
     *   (clean form) or "srt://:7000?mode=listener" (explicit form) — both
     *   work.  The clean form is preferred here for brevity.  The URL's
     *   empty host is interpreted as the wildcard address (0.0.0.0 for
     *   IPv4, :: for IPv6 when dual-stack is enabled), so the listener
     *   accepts connections from any interface.  For a loopback-only
     *   listener use "srt://127.0.0.1:7000".
     *
     * WHY no ?passphrase=... or ?pbkeylen=... here?
     *   Encryption parameters would require the connecting peer to supply
     *   the same passphrase.  This example pairs with a default sender and
     *   omits encryption for brevity.  For encrypted production code, add
     *   ?passphrase=<key>&pbkeylen=32 to both ends.
     *
     * tst_raw_receiver_open_listener blocks until the first peer connects,
     * then returns the accepted connection as the receiver handle.  The
     * listening socket is discarded after the first accept (single-peer
     * shape).  For a multi-peer accept loop use tst_managed_raw_receiver_t.
