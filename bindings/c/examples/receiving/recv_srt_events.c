/*
 * recv_srt_events.c — open the MANAGED (auto-reconnecting) SRT demux
 * receiver against a URL taken from argv[1] (caller or listener mode,
 * URL-driven — see below), walk every `tst_event_t` kind (including the
 * reconnect boundary marker), decode ST 0601 KLV inline, and shut down
 * via an async-signal-safe flag that the main thread polls on a bounded
 * `?x-recvtimeout` cadence — the actual lock-free `_cancel` call happens
 * on the main thread, never inside the signal handler (see the SIGINT
 * section below for why that distinction matters).
 *
 * Why this example:
 *   This is the BEHAVIORAL REFERENCE for the Apple/Swift wrapper — the
 *   shape a Swift `AsyncStream`-backed receiver is written against.
 *   Every choice below (which handle family, how cancel is sequenced,
 *   how KLV decode failure is handled, how the reconnect marker is
 *   surfaced) is a choice the Swift layer must reproduce, so it's
 *   documented as a decision, not just a call.
 *
 *   Diff from `recv_demux_to_console.c` (the older flagship event-walk
 *   example), which this example supersedes for the managed+caller+
 *   KLV-decode case:
 *     - `recv_demux_to_console.c` opens the PLAIN `tst_demux_receiver_t`
 *       via `_open_listener` with a hardcoded `srt://:7000` and ignores
 *       argv entirely. This example takes the URL from argv[1] and opens
 *       the MANAGED family (`tst_managed_demux_receiver_t`), which
 *       transparently retries the whole connect-through-first-byte
 *       sequence on transport failure per the configured
 *       `tst_reconnect_policy_t` (NULL here = library defaults).
 *     - `recv_demux_to_console.c`'s `kind_name()` switch has NO case for
 *       `TST_EVENT_KIND_RECONNECT_DISCONTINUITY` (kind 6) — it falls
 *       through to `default: "????"`. That event kind is emitted ONLY by
 *       the managed family (a plain `tst_demux_receiver_t` never reconnects,
 *       so it never fires), which is exactly why the older example never
 *       needed a case for it. This example is managed-only, so handling
 *       kind 6 correctly is the whole point, not an afterthought.
 *     - `recv_demux_to_console.c` prints raw struct fields for METADATA
 *       events (kind/pid/len/seq) but does not decode the KLV payload.
 *       This example decodes MISB ST 0601 inline via the Task-7 typed
 *       surface (`tst_st0601_decode` / `tst_st0601_geometry`) so callers
 *       can see the (value, state) contract that surface exposes.
 *
 * Caller mode vs listener mode — both from ONE code path:
 *   `tst_managed_demux_receiver_open`'s URL-driven mode dispatch matches
 *   `tst_demux_receiver_open`: a bare `srt://host:port` connects OUT as a
 *   caller (the shape a ground station uses against a camera's SRT
 *   listener); appending `?mode=listener` (e.g. `srt://:9000?mode=listener`
 *   or `srt://0.0.0.0:9000?mode=listener`) instead BINDS and waits for a
 *   peer to connect IN. There is no separate `_open_listener` call needed
 *   here — the query string alone selects the mode, so this one example
 *   covers both topologies a real deployment uses (ground-station-dials-
 *   camera vs camera-dials-ground-station).
 *
 * How to run:
 *   Both sender examples referenced below (`mux_synthetic_srt.c`,
 *   `poll_socket_stats.c`) only ever dial OUT as an SRT caller — neither
 *   has a listener mode — so in every recipe here THIS example is the
 *   listener the sender connects into.
 *
 *   Recipe 1 — quick event-shape demo (PROGRAM_MAP / SAMPLE / METADATA),
 *   ~0.4s total sender lifetime, DO NOT try to Ctrl-C mid-run (see the
 *   GOTCHA below — the window is too short to reliably land inside it):
 *     Terminal A:
 *       SRT_FORCE_VENDORED=1 cargo build -p tst-c --features srt
 *       cc -I bindings/c/include -L target/debug -Wall -Werror \
 *          -o /tmp/recv_srt_events \
 *          bindings/c/examples/receiving/recv_srt_events.c -ltstrans
 *       LD_LIBRARY_PATH=target/debug /tmp/recv_srt_events \
 *           'srt://:9000?mode=listener'
 *     Terminal B:
 *       cc -I bindings/c/include -L target/debug -Wall -Werror \
 *          -o /tmp/mux_synthetic_srt \
 *          bindings/c/examples/muxing/mux_synthetic_srt.c -ltstrans
 *       LD_LIBRARY_PATH=target/debug /tmp/mux_synthetic_srt 127.0.0.1:9000
 *     Verified output (5 AUs sent, 4 events land before the sender's
 *     linger/close races the demuxer's last read — this is normal, not
 *     a drop; the remaining AUs are still in flight when the process
 *     tree gets torn down at the end of this short-lived demo):
 *       [PMT ] program=1 pcr_pid=0x1011 pmt_pid=0x1000 streams=2 klv_links=1
 *       [META] klv decode failed bytes=33: buffer truncated at offset 17: needed 3 bytes, have 0
 *       [SMPL] pts=0 dts=- key=1 codec=H264 size=500 nals=1
 *       [META] klv decode failed bytes=33: buffer truncated at offset 0: needed 2 bytes, have 1
 *     Stop the receiver afterward with a single Ctrl-C: once the sender
 *     has disconnected the receiver is parked in its reconnect re-accept,
 *     and `_cancel` (this example's SIGINT path) wakes that too — see the
 *     NOTE below on the reconnect-search window.
 *
 *   Recipe 2 — reliable Ctrl-C / cancel-path demo (a 5-second continuous
 *   stream gives a wide, easy-to-hit window to cancel while GENUINELY
 *   blocked in `_recv_event` on a still-live connection — the scenario
 *   this example's SIGINT handling is built around):
 *     Terminal A: same `recv_srt_events 'srt://:9000?mode=listener'` as above.
 *     Terminal B:
 *       cc -I bindings/c/include -L target/debug -Wall -Werror \
 *          -o /tmp/poll_socket_stats \
 *          bindings/c/examples/operations/poll_socket_stats.c -ltstrans
 *       LD_LIBRARY_PATH=target/debug /tmp/poll_socket_stats srt://127.0.0.1:9000
 *     Press Ctrl-C on Terminal A any time in the first ~4.5s. Verified
 *     this session (log-timestamped, not wall-clock-guessed): shutdown
 *     lands roughly 30-45ms after the signal — bounded by one inter-event
 *     gap at 30fps (see `cancel_if_shutdown_requested`'s doc below), NOT
 *     by the `?x-recvtimeout` interval (500ms), which only matters on an
 *     idle stream. Exact event count depends on when you press Ctrl-C —
 *     not a fixed number. Clean exit, printing "receiver cancelled
 *     (SIGINT); <n> events received" then "end reason: CANCELLED".
 *
 *   Caller-mode variant of either recipe (swap who binds vs dials — point
 *   this example at a real listener instead, e.g. a camera or
 *   `srt-live-transmit srt://:9000?mode=listener ...`):
 *     LD_LIBRARY_PATH=target/debug /tmp/recv_srt_events srt://127.0.0.1:9000
 *
 *   NOTE — the reconnect-search window: if a peer disconnects and this
 *   listener-mode receiver goes looking for a NEW one (managed
 *   auto-reconnect), the reader thread is either waiting out the
 *   policy's backoff or parked in a fresh `accept()` with no peer in
 *   sight. Neither is bounded by `?x-recvtimeout` (SRTO_RCVTIMEO governs a
 *   connected socket's recv, not `srt_accept`), so the periodic wakeup
 *   this example relies on never fires there. What makes Ctrl-C land
 *   promptly in that window anyway is `_cancel` itself: the managed
 *   receiver's cancel interrupts the backoff wait AND closes the listener
 *   its factory is parked on, so `_recv_event` returns `TST_E_CLOSED`
 *   within milliseconds (pinned by the tst-c test
 *   `loopback_cancel_wakes_managed_listener_parked_in_reaccept`). Earlier
 *   builds ignored the cancel in this window and needed a `kill -9`.
 *   The one accept that still cannot be cancelled is the very FIRST one,
 *   inside `_open_listener` before any handle exists to cancel.
 *
 *   NOTE on `mux_synthetic_srt.c`'s KLV (Recipe 1 only): its `make_klv()`
 *   writes the 16-byte ST 0601 Universal Label + a BER length byte, but
 *   the 16 "value" bytes are just the frame sequence number repeated —
 *   NOT a real tag/length/value chain, and there's no trailing checksum
 *   tag (every real ST 0601 record ends with tag 1, a 2-byte BER-OID
 *   checksum). `tst_st0601_decode` on that payload hits the NULL /
 *   hard-decode-failure path below (verified above) — that's fine, it
 *   exercises exactly the "gracefully handle a non-decodable payload"
 *   branch this example is required to have. Point this example at a
 *   real MISB-conformant KLV source (a gimbaled-platform camera, or
 *   `tests/tools/gen_synthetic_fixtures`-produced fixtures muxed via a
 *   Rust sender) to see populated lat/lon/alt/hdg.
 *
 * Build (from the ts-transformer workspace root):
 *   SRT_FORCE_VENDORED=1 cargo build -p tst-c --features srt
 *   cc -I bindings/c/include \
 *      -L target/debug \
 *      -Wl,-rpath,target/debug \
 *      -Wall -Wextra -Werror \
 *      -o /tmp/recv_srt_events \
 *      bindings/c/examples/receiving/recv_srt_events.c -ltstrans
 *
 * Closest Rust analog: examples/receiving/srt_recv_typed.rs (plain,
 *   non-managed event walk — its comment at the ReconnectDiscontinuity
 *   match arm is the Rust-side explanation of the same kind-6 boundary).
 *   No Rust example currently exercises `ManagedDemuxReceiver` + typed
 *   ST 0601 decode together; this C example is the first.

 *
 * POSIX restricts a signal handler to a small set of async-signal-safe
 * operations (see `signal-safety(7)`) — an arbitrary tst-c entry point is
 * NOT on that list. `tst_managed_demux_receiver_cancel` runs Rust's
 * `catch_unwind` panic boundary, a trait-object virtual call, and
 * ultimately a libsrt socket close; none of that is async-signal-safe,
 * so calling it directly from a signal handler body (as an earlier
 * version of this example did) is undefined behavior under POSIX even
 * though it happened to work in practice on this platform. The fix: the
 * handler does the ONE thing `sig_atomic_t` + `volatile` guarantees is
 * safe — set a flag — and nothing else. No `_cancel`, no `printf`, no
 * `fprintf`.
 *
 * That alone would leave `_recv_event` blocked indefinitely on an idle
 * stream (it has no per-call timeout by default), so the flag would go
 * unread until the next packet arrives — which may be never. The main
 * loop instead checks the flag FROM MAIN (not from signal context) and
 * only THEN calls `_cancel`, via `cancel_if_shutdown_requested` (see its
 * doc below) — checked after every delivered event (bounds Ctrl-C
 * latency to about one inter-event gap on a BUSY stream) and on every
 * `?x-recvtimeout=<ms>` expiry (see `url_with_recv_timeout` below; bounds
 * it on an IDLE stream, where there's no event to hang the check off of).
 * Both are needed — see `cancel_if_shutdown_requested`'s doc for why
 * relying on the timeout alone leaves a busy stream unresponsive.
 *
 * A production consumer (or the Swift wrapper this example is written
 * for) that wants near-instant cancellation regardless of traffic would
 * instead run a small control thread that calls `_cancel` directly once
 * notified — that IS a safe pattern (lock-free, callable from any normal
 * thread — just not from a signal handler), and is the real shape a
 * cross-thread Swift cancellation API would use. This example uses
 * polling instead because it needs no extra thread.
