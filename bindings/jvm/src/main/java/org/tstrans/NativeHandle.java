/**
 * Abstract base for all JVM objects that own a native registry handle. Centralises the
 * double-free-critical {@code getAndSet(0)}-on-close idiom that was previously hand-copied
 * into every resource class.
 *
 * <p><b>Implementation detail.</b> This class is not part of the stable public API surface
 * and may change between releases. Users should program to the concrete subclass types
 * ({@link org.tstrans.mpegts.Muxer}, {@link org.tstrans.mpegts.Demuxer}, etc.).
 *
 * <p><b>Handle field shape.</b> The backing field is an {@link AtomicLong}: all concrete
 * subclasses are documented to support at least one cross-thread operation ({@code close()}
 * or an explicit cross-thread cancel), so {@code AtomicLong} is the appropriate minimum
 * visibility shape. {@link #consumeHandle()} and {@link #close()} use
 * {@link AtomicLong#getAndSet} so exactly one caller claims the handle; all subsequent
 * callers see 0 and either get a clean {@link IllegalStateException} or a no-op.
 *
 * <p><b>Subclass contract.</b>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Call {@link #setHandle(long)} once from the constructor with the native registry key.
 *   <li>Guard every public method with {@link #ensureOpen(String)} or
 *       {@link #requireOpen(String)}, then read the value via {@link #peekHandle()}.
 *   <li>For consuming-native sites (ownership transfer — e.g. {@code intoSender()}):
 *       call {@link #consumeHandle()} to atomically zero-and-capture the handle
 *       <em>before</em> the native call; a subsequent {@link #close()} then finds 0
 *       and is a harmless no-op. Conversely, a native that only <em>borrows</em>
 *       the handle without transferring ownership (a <b>sanctioned lease</b> —
 *       e.g. {@code RtspSession.intoDemuxReceiver()}, which moves the internal
 *       data plane but leaves the session's control plane usable) reads via
 *       {@link #peekHandle()} and does NOT consume; single-use enforcement for
 *       such sites lives in the Rust layer (a second call throws), not in the
 *       handle lifecycle.
 *   <li>Implement {@link #nativeClose(long)} by delegating to the subclass's own
 *       {@code private static native void nClose(long)} — JNI export names remain
 *       per-subclass, preserving the Maven ABI.
 * </ol>
