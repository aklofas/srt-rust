/**
 * Memory-safety stress test for the {@link Listener#close()} / {@link Listener#accept(Integer)}
 * race.
 *
 * <p>Before the lifetime fix, {@code close()} freed the {@code Box<Listener>} while another
 * thread was parked inside {@code srt_accept}. The {@code srt_close} fired by close woke the
 * parked accept, which then read its (now-freed) {@code accepted_*_timeout} fields → a
 * use-after-free that intermittently crashed the JVM worker with SIGSEGV.
 *
 * <p>The loop builds a listener on an ephemeral port, parks a thread in {@code accept()}, lets
 * it reach {@code srt_accept}, then calls {@code close()} from the main thread. After the fix,
 * close cancels the parked accept (it returns {@code CLOSED}) and only frees the allocation once
 * the parked accept has released the internal lock — no thread ever touches freed memory.
 *
 * <p><b>Sanctioned outcomes.</b> This is a RACE stress test: the 20ms pre-close pause makes the
 * parked interleaving overwhelmingly likely, but on a starved CI runner the accept thread can
 * lose the CPU past the pause + {@code close()}, so each iteration legitimately lands in exactly
 * one of the three clean interleavings the {@link Listener#close()} contract documents:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Parked wake</b> — accept was parked in {@code srt_accept}; close's cancel hook wakes
 *       it with libsrt {@code MJ_SETUP/MN_CLOSED} → {@code SrtException(CLOSED)}. The common
 *       case, and the interleaving this test exists to drive (asserted ≥ 1 of 50 below).</li>
 *   <li><b>Close-first entry</b> — accept() entered after {@code close()} claimed the registry
 *       id → clean {@link IllegalStateException} (from {@code ensureOpen()} or the registry's
 *       closed-handle arm). This was the historical CI flake: a sanctioned, memory-safe
 *       interleaving the test used to report as "unexpected".</li>
 *   <li><b>Cancelled entry</b> — accept won the registry lease but the cancel hook's
 *       {@code srt_close} landed before the {@code srt_accept} syscall, which then sees a
 *       closed/non-listening SRTSOCKET (libsrt {@code MN_SIDINVAL} / {@code MN_NOLISTEN},
 *       neither of which maps to ListenerClosed) → {@code SrtException(ACCEPT_FAILED)}.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Anything else — a successful accept (no peer exists), any other exception, or a JVM crash —
 * is a genuine failure. The memory-safety substance is unchanged: 50 close-vs-accept races with
 * no UAF/SIGSEGV and every accept thread unblocking promptly.
