"""Ephemeral-port allocators shared by SRT/RTP/TCP loopback tests.

Ask the OS for a free port, then release it immediately. Use the
allocator matching the protocol under test — `free_tcp_port()` for a
TCP listener/connect, `free_udp_port()` for a UDP bind. A port free
for one protocol is not guaranteed free for the other (the kernel
tracks UDP/TCP ports in separate namespaces, so cross-protocol reuse
is best-effort, not guaranteed). The tiny TOCTOU window between
release and rebind is fine since pytest runs these tests sequentially
by default.
