//! Muxer per-stream counter accounting + public stats accessor surface.
//!
//! Owns `MuxerStats` (the public snapshot struct) and the three public
//! accessor methods (`stats`, `reset_stats`, `stream_codec_stats`). The
//! per-PID counter-bump helpers (`bump_video_counters` /
//! `bump_klv_counters` / `bump_audio_counters`) are shared free functions
//! in `mpegts::stats` (also used by the demuxer's stats accounting).
//!
//! The `Muxer` struct's `ts_packets_emitted` / `ts_bytes_emitted` /
//! `per_stream` / `stream_codec_counters` fields back this module's
//! operations; they stay in the struct definition (`mod.rs`).
