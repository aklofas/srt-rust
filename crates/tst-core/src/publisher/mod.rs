//! **Stability: Provisional** — see the
//! [API stability reference](https://github.com/aklofas/ts-transformer/blob/main/docs/reference/api-stability.md).
//!
//! Outbound-only, segment-aware sinks (HLS, future MPEG-DASH, ...).
//!
//! Sits alongside [`crate::transport::Transport`] and
//! [`crate::transport::RecvTransport`] as a third trait family.
//!
//! Unlike `Transport`, a `Publisher` is outbound-only — there is no peer to
//! receive from. Unlike a simple byte sink, a `Publisher` is aware of segment
//! boundaries (e.g., HLS .ts segment cuts, .m3u8 playlist rotation).
