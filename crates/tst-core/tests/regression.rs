//! Domain harness: cross-impl interop regression tests (formerly wave_i*)
//! (consolidated from the former per-file tests/*.rs — see tests/MOVEMENT_MAP.md).
//!
//! Each `mod` below is one former top-level integration-test file, now
//! compiled into this single binary. Test bodies are unchanged; only the
//! module path gained a `regression::<file>::` prefix.
