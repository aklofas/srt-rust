#
# A regression here means either:
#   - the build.rs link-arg was dropped from emission
#   - libsrt has a new C-visible symbol the version-script didn't
#     anticipate (extremely unlikely — --exclude-libs=ALL is total)
#   - someone added a libsrt re-export to tst-c without going through
#     the Rust srt_sys::* binding path
#
# All three are real bugs.
