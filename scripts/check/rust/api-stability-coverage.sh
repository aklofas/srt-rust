# api-stability-coverage: every level-1 public module of every ratcheted
# crate must be covered by an EXACT row in docs/reference/api-stability.md
# (or a (crate) row), and every table row must still name a real `pub mod`
# line. Level-2 completeness is additionally enforced under tst_core::klv
# and tst_core::codec (tiering is per-dialect there). Coverage is
# deliberately strict, not prefix-based: a level-1 row must not be able to
# silently stand in for a missing level-2 row, or vice versa.
#
# Known coarsenesses (accepted):
# - Module extraction is scoped to `pub mod <lib>::<name>` lines anchored
#   at end-of-line, so it only ever sees real module paths — it does NOT
#   fall back to a bare `<lib>::[a-z_0-9]+` grep, which would also match
#   lowercase type/field names inside trait-impl or bindgen union lines
#   (e.g. `rist_sys::rist_stats_receiver_flow`) and demand table rows for
#   things that aren't modules at all.
# - Root-level re-exports (`tst_core::Transport`, `tst_rtp::compute_rtt_us`)
#   never produce a module path here (the regex requires a lowercase
#   first character after `<lib>::`, and re-exported items are typically
#   PascalCase types or already covered by the module that defines them)
#   — correct, per the page's "Root-level re-exports" section: a
#   root item's tier is whatever its defining module's row says.
